# Recipe Cost Calculator

### What it does?
This is a simple calculator for your recipes. Add the prices and the grams and see the cost of each ingredient and the sum for the complete recipe.

### More to come..
This is the first version that does the calcualtion in a step by step way. I am trying to refactor the code in another branch to add a more logical and clear calcualtion. After this transforamtion i am planning to add the rows with a button and also to remove them.

### The reason behind..
My brother is a chef and he wanted a tool to calculate the cost of some of the recipes that he is planning to add on his restaurant menu.
